title: My interest in the computer world
---

### The beginning of the story
It may seem interesting that about 5 years ago I was unable to communicate with a computer and didn't even know how to turn it on or off.
## The turning point of the story
During the Corona period, due to school and the lessons I had, I had to get acquainted with computers, and this acquaintance and communication continued over time until I was introduced to a new world called website design.
## web design
Thanks to an extracurricular class at school called Web Design, I was able to launch my first website.
The path was slowly and steadily becoming smoother for me to get closer to the computer.

## Choosing a Computer Engineering Major
And my hatred for computers turned into a passion for it, to the point where I chose this major for university and am currently studying it.
