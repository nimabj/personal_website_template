title: Computer Engineering at the University of Science and Technology
---
## University of Science and Technology
If I want to talk about the university itself, I have to say that it has a large space and an environment that attracts people
## Computer Engineering
I also have to say about the computer engineering field that it is a bit difficult, but I think most people who are taking it are interested in it.

## Basic Programming: Hard
Of course, we should not forget the basics course, which is really a difficult course and takes a lot of time to become proficient in it. In this course, we will learn about programming and the Python language, drawing and graphics with the help of Turtle and programming logic.
